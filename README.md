# Britt's nutrition tracker

This is a web component based application used for weekly meal planning.

The application currently allows the user to view their weekly meals with ingredients and add anything they don't have to a shopping list.

To-do list:
- [X] Establish a backend to store meals in some sort of database
- [ ] Add authentication (may be a later thing)
- [X] Implement the grocery list
- [X] Add a way to create your own meals
- [ ] Support importing meals from other sites/pinterest
